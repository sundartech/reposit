# Security

In addition to security considerations associated with JREs, containers, and frameworks, the
following points pertain to the security of the Buildpack itself.

## Buildpack Forks

If you fork the Liberty Buildpack, keep the fork up to date with the
original repository to ensure that your fork runs with all the necessary security fixes.

## Security and Logs

See [Sensitive Information in Logs](logging.md#Sensitive-Information-in-Logs).
